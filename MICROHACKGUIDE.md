# Pre-requisites

## Overview

In order to use the MicroHack time most effectively, the following tasks should be completed prior to starting the session.

With these pre-requisites in place, we can focus on building the differentiated knowledge in Cosmos DB that is required when working with the product, rather than spending hours repeating relatively simple tasks. 

At the end of this section your base lab build looks as follows:

## Task 1 : Do Somthing

Add my instuctions for this task 

## Task 2 : Do Somthing

Add my instuctions for this task 

## Task 3 : Do Somthing

Add my instuctions for this task 

## Task 4 : Do Somthing

Add my instuctions for this task
